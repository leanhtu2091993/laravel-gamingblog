                        <p>When the first games came out in the late 70s early 80s – remember Pong anyone? – it was impossible to predict where the video game industry would take us. It’s gone so far and so fast in such a short amount of time. With every new technological advance, there are crowds of highly intelligent and progressive developers waiting in the wings to take it and turn it into something that’s more fun than you could have dreamt of back in the 80s.</p>

                        <p>Ultimately, it is still difficult to accurately predict the future of consoles but we have a pretty good idea of what it will be. For Xbox, it may be re-releasing improved consoles like mobiles, while PlayStation could focus on the VR experience and we reckon Nintendo will continue to break all gaming trends with their portable devices. What do you think the future holds?</p>
